# DockerizedReactApp
This is a test repo for better understanding the interactions of a dockerized react app talking to a dockerized node backend.

# The actual implementation I want to end up with after this test is completed:
  - Stand up an API container
  - Use a dockerized React app to fetch and display the job statuses from the API container
